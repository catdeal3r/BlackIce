# SCreate - A simpler alternative to make

SCreate is a simple alternative to make with intensionally less features.

It is designed to purely compile c and c++ code with gcc and g++, reading off of a toml file.

I created this project because:
- I was frustrated with the complexity of cmake/make
- I wanted something that could compile object files like cmake/make does to reduce compile times, which is something that a shell script would make annoying to implement.
- Finally, for the learning value
